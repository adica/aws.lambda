# AWS lambda functions introduction


On 2015 Amazon introduces us [AWS Lambda functions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) - a serverless compute platform for stateless code execution in response to triggers.


Basically - you can split your code into small stateless functions (microservices) that execute in response to triggers. Those triggers can be:
- HTTP request to specific end -point
- File PUT event on s3 bucket
- AWS SDK event call
- New event on SQS (AWS queue system)


When you use Lambda functions - you can reduce significantly server maintenance complexability (no need to launch server instance, configure it, handle scaling, monitoring, security, versioning etc.).

Instead - all you need to do is to configure this functions with the AWS interface and deploy your code into it (just upload zip file).


Then you can continue working on new features or improve your current oneâ€™s, without worrying about all these infrastructure issues.


From now on you will enjoy those features:
- Your code will be highly secured on AWS servers
- Your code will auto scale when needed
- You will Pay only when your code is running (if you still don't have customers - you won't pay anything)
- Very easy way to deploy new versions, and no downtimes
- Built-in monitoring with [cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

Here is a simple example of Lambda function that triggered when someone put a file on s3.

You can see that AWS gives us simple function signature with 3 parameters:
- event - the event that triggers this function
- context - some data about the context this function run at
- callback - to execute when we want to resolve it.

This function does the following:
- read the file location from the event (lines 7-8)
- goes to s3 bucket and retrieve this file (line 11)
- use 'gm' (package that wraps 'image-magic' - a tool for image processing) to convert PDF to thumb PNG image (lines 15-18)
- upload the thumb PNG image back to s3 bucket (line 22)

As you can see - we don't need to worry about anything else than our logic. this is very good news!

AWS lambda functions have some disadvantages (mostly latency issues)- but I personally think this kind of services will be the future of code deployments, and you should give it a try and test it by yourself.
